# 🧬 NovaGen Research Labs – Machine Learning Project

## Problem Statement
NovaGen Research Labs requires an intelligent system to identify high-risk patients.
Missing a high-risk patient can be life-threatening, so recall is prioritized.

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Voting Classifier

## Evaluation Metric
- Recall (primary)
- Accuracy (secondary)

## Results
| Model | Recall |
|------|--------|
| Logistic Regression | 82.8% |
| KNN | 88.3% |
| Random Forest | 95.8% |
| Gradient Boosting | 94.9% |
| Voting Classifier | 93.07% |

## Final Model
✅ Random Forest selected due to highest recall.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Lab

## Key Learning
- Importance of recall in healthcare ML
